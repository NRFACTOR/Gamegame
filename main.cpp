/*
 What are you waiting for?!
 Code like there is no tomorrow!
 And when tomorrow inevitably arrives, be able to truthfully tell yourself:
 "I have bettered myself, and am that much closer improving the world."
 
 This, and all included files, were programmed from scratch by Nicholas Rebhun.
 
 Dedicated to Gabrielle Miseroy.
 I love you.
